<h2>About Pular</h2>
<p><b>Pular</b> is spoken in the area that once comprised the theocratic kingdom
of the Fuuta Jallon (most of which is in modern-day Guinea). Other dialects in
the area are <b>Fulakunda</b>, spoken in Casamance (southern Senegal) and parts
of Guinea-Bissau and Gambia; and <b>Pulaar</b>, the language of the Toroobhe
(Toucouleur) in Northern and southeastern Senegal and southern Mauritania (as
well as in Dinguiraye in Guinea). Other forms of Pular are spoken in Niger,
Mali, Nigeria, Burkina Faso, and Cameroon. Linguists sometimes refer to Pular
and its first cousins by the generic name of <b>Fulfulde</b>.</p>
<p>It is a useful language in West Africa, not only because it has relatives in
so many different countries, but also because the Fulbhe-Fuuta are everywhere.
As a result of large emigration movements over the last 50-60 years, every West
African capital has a colony of Fulbhe traders, merchants, etc. Today there are
over 2.5 million speakers of the Fuuta Jallon dialect, out of around 14 million
Pular speakers total.</p>
